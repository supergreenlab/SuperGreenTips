    It's going to take a few days for the soil to dry, checking every 2 days is a good frequency.
    Should you water?
    1. Sight: look at the soil, does it look dry? yes->step2
    2. Touch: place finger in the soil 1 knuckle deep, is the soil dry? yes->step3
    3. Weight: pick up the pot, does it feel very light? yes-> time to water :)
    *note: it's safer to let the soil dry an extra day if you are unsure than to water and risk over-watering*
